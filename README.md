### Summary

This repo contains a short analysis of quantitative and categorical features from online reviews from 21 hotels located in Las Vegas Strip, extracted from TripAdvisor. The original [data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00397/LasVegasTripAdvisorReviews-Dataset.csv) is downloaded from the [Machine Learning Repository of UC Irvine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Las+Vegas+Strip) into the [ipython notebook](https://github.com/peter0083/las_vegas_hotel_reviews/blob/master/src/vegas_trip_analysis.ipynb). The dataset contains 504 records and tuned features from
24 per hotel (two per each month, randomly selected), regarding the year of 2015. The CSV contains a header, with the names of the columns corresponding to the features marked Exploratory data analysis and machine learning models are built in hope to identify key features that result in high or low hotel scores. The analysis can be reproduced by cloning this repo to your local machine and executing the code cells in the ipython notebook.
